# @tailor-cms/ce-table-server

Server-side module for the **Table** content element in [Tailor CMS](https://github.com/tailor-cms/author).

Provides the server half of the element: state initialisation, lifecycle hooks and any AI configuration, registered by the Tailor server runtime.

## Installation

```sh
npm install @tailor-cms/ce-table-server
```

## Usage

Content elements are normally registered with Tailor through the element
registry rather than imported directly, but the package can be consumed on its
own:

```ts
import serverModule from '@tailor-cms/ce-table-server';
```

## Element

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Table |
| Type | `TABLE` |
| Icon | [`mdi-table`](https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/) |
| Composite | Yes |
